# INTERFACE CREATED USING HTML AND CSS

#### The HTML is an index page containing a simple interface styled using css. It contains some random info about "MICHEANGELO" and a qoute by "E.Roosevelt"

#### Almost at the bottom is a simple form that asks for Name, Email and Message, and has a submit button.

#### Ends with a Footer.

#### Also contains 5 links at the top, but only Home is active. On the right, is a sidebar with 4 links (all disabled). And a Contacts tab with random info.
